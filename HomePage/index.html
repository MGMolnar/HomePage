    <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>Marc Molnar, so much more to myself than just a name or a face. Hobbies, goals, <BR>
        friends, family, relationships, and much more are behind a name. There is so much more<BR>
        to know about someone than what can scratch the surface. Well this is it, a bio about<BR>
        myself, Marc Molnar.</p>

        <img src="images/myPhoto.jpg" alt="Picture of Marc Molnar">

        <p>Hello, I am Marc Molnar a Game Design and Development Major at Rochester Institute of Technology. <BR>I am a second year and I have
        already done so much at RIT. As of now I am pursuing an esport player<BR> position on the Call of Duty Team, and I am learning
        to take the position of treasure for the RIT paintball team.<BR> These take up a lot of my time, however I did manage to get 
        some time for a job as well. I work at<BR> Commons around 9 - 10 hours as week, which makes up another big portion of my time.<BR>
        On top of all this I still had to manage school, friends, and a relationship. As of now I made many friends<BR> along my way to 
        where I am now. We all try to go out to lunch at 12 every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.<BR> As of September 18, 2019, my girlfriend,
        katie, and I are going on one year being together in a relationship.<BR> Now saying all of this there is still more I want to achieve.
        For now, I have a few goals, keeping a 3.5 GPA,<BR> nail down an internship, and make the top roster on the Call of Duty Team. During 
        the rest of my time here at RIT,<BR> I want to create more passion projects that I am proud of and willing to share to potential employers.<BR>
        Lastly, when I leave RIT I want to be able to hold down a job and be fine finacially.</p>
